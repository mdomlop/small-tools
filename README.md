Tiny tools
===========

Some small programming exercises that have resulted in some useful tools.

This package includes:
---------------------

- **ackermann**: Implements the Ackermann function to obtain big numbers.

   Too bigs even for our universe.
   
- **collatz**: Shows Collatz conjecture results.

    Prints the number of steps to reach number 1 as result, meaning that the
conjecture works for the given number. Otherwise if a result were yet reached
this will mean that the Collatz conjecture fails, and you can reclaim your
award.

    Good luck!
    
- **einstein**: Calculates the energy produced in ergs from converting a given mass to grams.

- **hrzones**: Helps to calculate your Heart rate zones.

- **limit**: Show the limits of your machine.

- **rule3**: Calculates the rule of three.

- **tvinch**: Find the diagonal inches, and aspect ratio, of a rectangle of known size. Like, for example, a TV.

- **tvsize**: Calculates the size and area of a rectangle of known proportions. Like, for example, a TV.

- **wheatchess**: If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one
grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third,
and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square), how many
grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?
